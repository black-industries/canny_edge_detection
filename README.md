# canny_edge_detection
Using canny edge detection algorithm for edge detection

I followed this tutorial https://towardsdatascience.com/canny-edge-detection-step-by-step-in-python-computer-vision-b49c3a2d8123

After i have successful with the tutorial (canny_edge_detectio.ipynb), i decided to go a step further. So I downloaded a short video (not in the code) which i stored in videos folder. 
Turned the videos into pictures using open cv, then performed uncanny edge detection on the pictures, thereafter i sticked the new pictures (the ones that had
their edges detected already) into a video. 

All this is done the **edge_detection_video.ipynb** 

Feeel free to ask questions.
